## üìö Project Overview

FreeReads enables Berlin residents to:

- **üìç Locate nearby book hubs** across the city
- **üìö Browse available books**, both citywide and in their vicinity
- **üß∞ Manage donated books** for better tracking and accessibility
- **ü§ù Contribute to a community library** that everyone can enjoy

Our mission is to create a seamless platform where anyone in Berlin can discover and access quality reading material‚Äîcompletely free of charge.

## üèó Architecture

![FreeReads Architecture](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhlhrakma/image/upload/v1744225616/freereads/readme/freereads_simplified-architecture-diagram_yinesn.png)

FreeReads follows a modern, containerized microservices architecture optimized for scalability and performance:

- **NGINX Layer**: Reverse proxy handling SSL, load balancing, and security headers
- **Node.js/Express Layer**: RESTful API with business logic and authentication
- **Redis Layer**: High-performance caching, token blacklisting, and rate limiting
- **MongoDB Layer**: Document database with geospatial capabilities for hub location

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js/Express RESTful API
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with separate access/refresh tokens and blacklisting
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger for interactive API documentation
- **Validation**: Input validation and error handling middleware
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization and token blacklisting
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud for book scanning and ISBN detection
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, NGINX for production deployment
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- **Hosting**: Render Cloud Platform

## üåü Key Features

- **Geospatial Book Hub Locator**: Find the nearest places to pick up or drop off books
- **Book Scanning API**: Easily add books to the system by scanning barcodes or ISBN using Google Cloud Vision
- **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and token refresh system with JWT
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permission levels (member, boss, overlord)
- **Real-time Availability**: Up-to-date information on book availability
- **Comprehensive API Documentation**: Fully documented with interactive Swagger/OpenAPI interface

## ü§ñ AI & Computer Vision

FreeReads leverages artificial intelligence to enhance the book-sharing experience:

### Current Implementation

- **Google Cloud Vision Integration**
  - Automatic ISBN detection from book cover images
  - Text recognition technology to extract book identifiers
  - Seamless integration with Google Books API for metadata
  - User-friendly scanning experience with minimal input required

### Future AI Enhancements

As part of my ongoing deep learning studies at TechLabs, I plan to develop:

- **Custom Computer Vision Models** tailored specifically for book recognition
- **Natural Language Processing** for book categorization and recommendation
- **Personalized Recommendation Engine** based on borrowing patterns
- **Book Condition Assessment** using image analysis

This AI integration demonstrates practical machine learning implementation skills while laying the groundwork for more advanced custom solutions that will make FreeReads an increasingly intelligent platform.

## üöÄ Project Roadmap

FreeReads is an evolving platform with ambitious plans for growth and innovation:

  - Geospatial visualization of book hubs on interactive maps

### Deep Learning Integration (Q3-Q4 2025)

As part of my upcoming TechLabs Deep Learning track studies, I plan to integrate advanced AI capabilities:

- **Book Recommendation Engine**
  - Collaborative filtering based on user borrowing patterns
  - Content-based recommendations using book metadata
  - Hybrid recommendation approach for cold-start problems
  - Personalized reading suggestions based on past activity

- **Natural Language Processing**
  - Book description analysis for improved categorization
  - Sentiment analysis of book reviews
  - Automated genre classification from book content
  - Text summarization for book descriptions

### AI Enhancements (Q1-Q2 2026)

Following the deep learning track, I'll be applying specialized AI knowledge to:

- **Computer Vision Improvements**
  - Book cover recognition without ISBN
  - Condition assessment from book images
  - Automated categorization based on visual elements
  - Multi-book detection in a single image

- **Predictive Analytics**
  - Book availability forecasting
  - Hub usage pattern analysis
  - Seasonal trend identification
  - Demand-based hub location suggestions

### Mobile Application (Q3-Q4 2026)

The ultimate goal is to transform FreeReads into a comprehensive mobile experience:

- **Cross-Platform Mobile App**
  - React Native implementation for iOS and Android
  - Native device feature integration (camera, GPS, notifications)
  - Offline-first architecture with synchronization
  - Barcode/QR code scanning for quick book checkout

## üöÄ Scalability Architecture

FreeReads is built with horizontal scaling capabilities to handle growing demand:

- **Stateless Application Design**
  - Containerized services with Docker
  - JWT authentication eliminating server-side sessions
  - Independent application instances without shared local state
  - NGINX load balancing across multiple containers

- **Distributed Infrastructure**
  - Redis for centralized token blacklisting and rate limiting
  - MongoDB with sharding capabilities for database scaling
  - Geospatial indexing optimized for location-based queries
  - Connection pooling for efficient resource management

- **Cloud-Native Deployment**
  - Auto-scaling configuration on Render platform
  - Zero-downtime deployment pipeline
  - Environment-specific configuration
  - Infrastructure as code for consistent environments

This architecture allows FreeReads to scale horizontally by adding more application instances as user demand grows, rather than being limited to vertical scaling of individual servers.

## üîí Security & Performance
