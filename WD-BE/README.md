- **API Tests**: Test API endpoints with supertest
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user flows

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/unit/services/jwt.test.js

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

### Test Structure

Tests are organized to mirror the project structure:

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jwt.test.js
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blacklist.test.js
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middlewares/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-middleware.test.js
